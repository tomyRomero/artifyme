## <a name="overview">üåê Overview </a>
ArtifyMe is a mobile application that allows users to convert sketches into images using AI. The app has a React Native frontend for the mobile interface, a Java Spring Boot backend with jwt authentication that handles server operations, and a Python FastAPI for generating images from sketches using Stable Diffusion.

## <a name="setup"> ‚öôÔ∏è Setup </a>

Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tomyRomero/artifyme`

Please place close attention to the env examples for the frontend as well as the application properties example for the backend (found in src/main/resources/). Ensure you have set the proper variables before starting the application or you will experience errors.

**Frontend:**
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`

Ensure that you have java and maven installed with the necessary versions, they can be found in the pom.xml, for example the java I used was 20, and Maven was 4.0.0, spring-boot was 3.2.3. Ensure that you have these systems up and running if you want to test the server locally, ensure that you have maven and java as environmental variables on your pc.

**Backend:**
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies: `mvn clean install`
3. Start the Spring Boot server: `mvn spring-boot:run`

**AI Integration:**
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fastapi`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the Python server: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
3. Install Stable Diffusion library: on the first initial run allow for the stable diffusion model to be downloaded, 
please note that speed of image generation depends on strength of computer, you can increase the number of inference steps, main.py for better results however will result in longer wait times.

In main.py, line 25, the code is for macOS
`pipe = pipeline.to("mps")` 
For Windows or Linux systems, you can use "cuda" instead of "mps" if you have a compatible GPU and CUDA installed. "cuda" will utilize the GPU for faster processing.

If you don't have a compatible GPU or CUDA installed, you can use "cpu" to run the model on the CPU.

Ensure all three softwares are up and running for app to be fully functional.

## Future Updates
In the future, I would love to further optimize the app for Android devices and improve responsiveness across various screen sizes. Additionally, I aim to enhance the AI model by training it more extensively to deliver even better results.
